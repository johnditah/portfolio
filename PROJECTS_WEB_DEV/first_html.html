             <h1>Music</h1>
             I love music because it helps people communicate how they feel
             inside when they just can't find the words to say it. Sometimes,
             in our lives, it is difficult to say how we feel to other people,
             but with music we find the words that are missing and the messages
             hat we are trying to tell people. We all can find the words 
             that we are looking for by either writing songs or just listening
             to different songs on the radio or anywhere we are. I know when 
             I have trouble finding the words that I want to say to people, 
             I write songs to express how I feel about them or different things 
             in life. Music is important because music helps us find the words
             we can't say.
