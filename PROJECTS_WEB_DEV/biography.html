    <h1> My Biography</h1>
    <p>
        I've achieved my BSc with a major in Mathematics 
        and Computer Science from the University of Buea 
        Cameroon and a major in Civil Engineering from 
        National Advanced School of Public Works. I've 
        attained over a decade of experience ranging from 
        Staff field assistant to Senior Civil Engineering 
        Technician. Until 2018, I was employed as a Senior
        Civil Engineering Technician with Regional Delegation
        of Housing and Urban Development, wherein I 
        supervised the design and building of construction 
        projects. I am now motivated and eager to apply my
        experience along with my IT skills to impact and 
        empower teams within an organisation to achieve its
        business goals.
